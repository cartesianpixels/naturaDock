## Session Achievements

- **Added `openpyxl` to `requirements.txt`**: This was necessary for exporting results to XLSX format.
- **Updated `qa/assessments/pipeline.initial-build-trace-20250915.md`**: The traceability matrix was updated to reflect the increased test coverage and the current state of the project.
- **Fixed `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'openpyxl'`**: Installed `openpyxl` to resolve this error in `test_analysis.py`.
- **Fixed `TypeError: run_vina_docking() takes 4 positional arguments but 5 were given`**: Corrected the calls to `run_vina_docking` in `test_docking.py` and `src/naturaDock/main.py` after removing the `log_file` argument.
- **Refactored `src/naturaDock/analysis/results.py`**: Modified `parse_vina_log` to `parse_vina_result` and updated it to extract binding affinity from Vina output PDBQT files instead of log files.
- **Updated `tests/test_analysis.py`**: Modified the test to use the new `parse_vina_result` function and PDBQT files.
- **Implemented automatic binding site calculation**: Modified `src/naturaDock/preprocessing/protein.py` to calculate the binding site based on the protein's geometric center, and updated `src/naturaDock/main.py` and `tests/test_cli.py` accordingly.
- **Debugged Vina affinity scores**: Investigated why Vina was consistently returning 0.0 affinity scores. It was determined that the ligands were outside the grid box.
- **Achieved all tests passing**: After addressing the above issues, all tests are now passing.
