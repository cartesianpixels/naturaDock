#naturaDock

A reproducible pipeline for screening natural compounds against protein targets using AutoDock Vina, RDKit, and Biopython.

Designed as both a learning project and a research tool for computational drug discovery.

##Features

\- Fetch compounds from PubChem or local libraries

\- Filter & clean compounds (MW, duplicates, conformers)

\- Prepare protein structures (download, clean, define binding site)

\- Dock compounds using AutoDock Vina

\- Rank and analyze docking scores

\- Visualize results (plots + binding poses)
