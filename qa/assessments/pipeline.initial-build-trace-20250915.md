### Critical Gaps

1.  **No Test Coverage**
    -   **Gap**: There are no automated tests (unit, integration, or E2E) for any of the functional requirements. The entire codebase lacks a test suite.
    -   **Risk**: High - Without tests, any change can introduce regressions. There is no way to automatically verify the correctness of the implementation.
    -   **Action**: Implement a testing framework (e.g., `pytest`) and create a comprehensive test suite covering all functional requirements.

### Test Design Recommendations

1.  **Implement a Test Framework**: Introduce `pytest` for writing unit and integration tests.
2.  **Unit Tests**: Create unit tests for each function in the `src` directory (`analysis.py`, `compounds.py`, `docking.py`, `protein.py`, `visualize.py`).
3.  **Integration Tests**: Create integration tests that verify the interaction between the different modules of the pipeline.
4.  **Test Data**: Create a small, well-defined dataset of compounds and proteins for testing purposes.
5.  **Mocking**: Use mocking libraries (e.g., `unittest.mock`) to isolate components and mock external APIs (PubChem, etc.).

### Risk Assessment

-   **High Risk**: All 15 functional requirements have no test coverage. This is a critical issue that needs to be addressed immediately.
