### Critical Gaps

1.  **Incomplete Test Coverage**
    -   **Gap**: While unit tests have been improved, there is still no test coverage for the `main` module's argument parsing and configuration handling. The end-to-end test is still failing.
    -   **Risk**: Medium - The core logic is mostly tested, but the CLI entry point is not, which could lead to usability issues.
    -   **Action**: Fix the end-to-end test and add unit tests for the `main` module.

### Test Design Recommendations

1.  **Fix End-to-End Test**: The immediate priority is to fix the failing `test_cli.py` to ensure the pipeline runs from start to finish.
2.  **Write Unit Tests for `main`**: Test the CLI argument parsing and configuration file handling in isolation.
3.  **Improve Existing Tests**: The tests for the analysis module could be improved by using more realistic data.

### Risk Assessment

-   **Medium Risk**: The project is in a much better state, but the failing end-to-end test and lack of coverage for the CLI entry point still pose a risk.
